This problem is about the sufficient and necessary condition. 

Basically, given a bi-implication, that is, `q if and only if p`, then we can use the truth value of one to exactly predict the other. In other words, they have equivalent boolean values.

In this problem, we can use the given information as equations, and generate a second set of equations using the first (via algebra). Now, we know that the first set implies the second (since we derived the latter from it). However, we need to generate enough equations in the second set so that given the second set, we can regenerate the entire first set altogether. This means that we have a bi-implication, and hence we have found the sufficient and necessary condition.

This sufficient and necessary condition just happens to be easily computable using the given input.

## Python code
```py
c11, c12, c13 = map(int,input().split())
c21, c22, c23 = map(int,input().split())
c31, c32, c33 = map(int,input().split())

if (c12 - c11 == c22 - c21 == c32 - c31) and (c13 - c12 == c23 - c22 == c33 - c32) and (c13-c11 == c23 - c21 == c33-c31) :
    print('Yes')
else :
    print('No')
